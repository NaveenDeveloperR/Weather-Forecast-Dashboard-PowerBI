# Weather Forecast Power BI Dashboard  

This Power BI dashboard provides a 5-day weather forecast (Aug 30 – Sep 3, 2025) for six Indian cities — Bengaluru, Chennai, Hyderabad, Mumbai, Noida, and Vellore — using real-time data from the OpenWeather API. It is built with Power Query for data extraction and transformation, DAX for calculations and measures, data modeling for structuring relationships, and visualization design for creating interactive and user-friendly dashboards. The project transforms raw API data into an engaging and interactive weather story, offering clear insights into temperature trends, humidity, rainfall, wind speed, wind direction, UV index, visibility, as well as sunrise and sunset timings.
